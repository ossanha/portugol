* Compilation

** Command line version
This remains a not-so-simple process. You will need:
- OCaml >= 4.02.1
- ocamlgraph >= 1.8.6
- menhir 20141215
- lwt

All of these dependencies can be installed through the [[https://opam.ocaml.org/][OPAM]]
package manager.

** Web version

All what is needed for the [[*Command%20line%20version][Command line version]] and also:

- js_of_ocaml

It is recommended to use OPAM for this dependency too.

* Local use of web GUI

Point your browser at the ~www/index.html~ file under the source directory
should work out-of-the box.
